# json_vs_pickle
A small demo showing JSON vs Pickle in Python,

I wrote these scripts to show in a comment in https://www.reddit.com/r/PythonLearning/comments/1hr4s25/how_to_write_elements_into_a_list_in_another_file/
However reddit kept rejecting the comment with the code in it, so I'm putting it on GitHub instead.

There is nothing fancy here, it's a crude demo.
